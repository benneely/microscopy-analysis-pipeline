# ihc-analysis-pipeline
Official codebase used to segment anatomical
structures and cells from the LungMAP project.

## Examples
In order to replicate many of the samples, we recommend
getting a local copy of images used for testing and
training which can be found [here](https://github.com/duke-lungmap-team/ihc-image-data).
